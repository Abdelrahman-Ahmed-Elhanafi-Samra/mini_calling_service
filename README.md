Percent:  $\begin{cases} \xrightarrow{\hspace{2cm}} \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Total}} \times 100 \\ \xrightarrow{\hspace{2cm}} \frac{\text{change}}{\text{original}} \times 100 \rightarrow \text{change} \rightarrow \text{Diff} \end{cases}$

\* what Percent of total is Part ?

\* what Percent of  $\underbrace{300}_{\text{Total}}$  is  $\underbrace{150}_{\text{Part}}$ ?  $P = \frac{150}{300} \times 100 = 50\%$

\* 40% of 200 is what number?  
 $\begin{matrix} \text{Part} & \text{Total} \end{matrix}$

$$\text{Part} = \text{Percent} \times \text{total} = 40\% \times 200 = \frac{40}{100} \times 200 = 80$$

\* 60% is 70 of what number?

$$\text{Total} = \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Percent}} = \frac{70}{40\%} =$$

\* Percent of change:  $\begin{cases} \xrightarrow{\hspace{1cm}} \text{Inc} \\ \xrightarrow{\hspace{1cm}} \text{Dec.} \end{cases}$

$$= \frac{\text{change}}{\text{original}} \times 100$$

Jane bought a mobile from store and the price was 300 \$, <sup>original.</sup> But after she got a discount, she paid 150 \$ Find Percent of discount?

$$\text{Percent} = \frac{300 - 150}{300} \times 100 = \frac{150}{300} \times 100 = 50\%$$

{1}------------------------------------------------

\* New Value after: ( Inc - Dec )

$$56\% = \frac{56}{100} = 0.56$$

$$7\% = \frac{7}{100} = 0.07$$

$$40\% = \frac{40}{100} = \frac{4}{10} = 0.40 = 0.4$$

---

$$1 + 40\% = 1.40 \rightarrow 100\% + 40\% = 1.40$$

$$1 + 57\% = 1.57$$

$$1 + 3\% = 1.03$$

$$1 - 40\% = 0.60 \rightarrow 100 - 40 = 0.60$$

$$1 - 57\% = 0.43$$

$$1 - 3\% = 0.97$$

---

New value after Inc: ( Profit, Tax, earn, growth, ..... )

$$\text{New} = \text{Original} (1 + P\%)$$

New value after decrease: ( Sale, discount, off, ..... )

$$\text{New} = \text{Original} (1 - P\%)$$

Omar bought a laptop from store which gave him 20%

Discount off the original. If the price was 500 \$, And

He found that he will pay 8% sales tax. Find total amount he should pay?

$$500 (1 - 20\%) (1 + 8\%)$$

$$500 (0.80) (1.08)$$

{2}------------------------------------------------

\* Compound interest:

$$\text{New} = \text{Original} \left( 1 + \frac{P\%}{n} \right)^{nt}$$

$n \rightarrow$  Compounded interval.

$t \rightarrow$  years.

Compounded annually  $\rightarrow n = 1$

After  
every.

“ semiannually  $\rightarrow n = 2$

“ quarterly  $\rightarrow n = 4$

“ monthly  $\rightarrow n = 12$

\* MaZen opened bank account that gave him 2%

Interest Compounded monthly every 5 years. If

He deposits 100\$ in his account without withdrawing.

Find total amount after 10 years?

$$= 100 \left( 1 + \frac{2\%}{12} \right)^{\frac{12(10)}{5}}$$

\* Moriam make a scientific experiment and she has

10 cells, she found that the number of cells doubles  
every 20 minutes, Find total number after 2 hours?

$$10 \left( 2 \right)^{\frac{2 \times 60}{20}}$$

Quadrable  $\rightarrow$  Multiply 4.
